# YoutubeAPI

For my Data Science for Business class I'm taking this semester, we are working on a Capstone Data Project with my group. <br>
Here's the criteria for the project: <br>
1. Identify a business problem that you can solve or address with data. <br> 
2. Work through the Data Science Process: <br>
Business Understanding ---> Data Understanding ---> Data Preparation ---> Exploratory Data Analysis ---> Modelling ---> Evaluation ---> Deployment <br>

We decided to look at how to optimize the success of a YouTube channel – initiatives to increase views, subscribers etc. as well as YouTube's algorithm. 
We will be using [Google's YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube) to access the data of a chosen channel. 
The project is still in progress but the Jupyter Notebook attached contains the API data I have accessed thus far.
